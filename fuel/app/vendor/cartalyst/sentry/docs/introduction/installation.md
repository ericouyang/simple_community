###Installation

#### Installing In Laravel 4 (with Composer)

There are four simple steps to install Sentry into Laravel 4:

1. Add `"cartalyst/sentry": "2.0.*"` to the `require` attribute of your `composer.json` *(requires you run `php composer.phar update` from the command line)*
2. Add `Cartalyst\Sentry\SentryServiceProvider` to the list of service providers in `app/config/app.php`
3. Add `'Sentry' => 'Cartalyst\Sentry\Facades\Laravel\Sentry'` to the list of class aliases in `app/config/app.php` *(optional)*
4. If you'd like to migrate tables, simply run `php artisan migrate --package=cartalyst/sentry` from the command line. Of course, feel free to write your own migrations which insert the correct tables if you'd like!


#### Installing in FuelPHP 1.x (with Composer)

Using Sentry with FuelPHP is easy. We begin by creating the `composer.json` file at `fuel/app/` with the following:

```json
{
	"require": {
		"cartalyst/sentry": "2.0.*",
		"illuminate/database": "4.0.*",
		"ircmaxell/password-compat": "1.0.*"
	},
	"minimum-stability": "dev"
}
```

Navigate to your `app` folder in Terminal and run `composer update`. You must put the following in `app/bootstrap.php` below `Autoloader::register()`:

```php
// Enable composer based autoloading
require APPPATH.'vendor/autoload.php';
```

Great! You now have composer working with FuelPHP. Just one more step is involved now, right at the bottom of that same file, `app/bootstrap.php`, put the following:

```php
class_alias('Cartalyst\Sentry\Facades\FuelPHP\Sentry', 'Sentry');
```

This will mean you can use the FuelPHP Sentry facade as the class `Sentry`. VÃ²ila! Sentry automatically works with your current database configuration, there is no further setup required.

##### A small note

Sentry will always run off the default database connection, so ensure this is working. We may look at adding support for alternate connections in the future however it is not implemented at this stage. Pull requests are welcome.


#### Installing in CodeIgniter 3.0-dev+ (with Composer)

Installation in CodeIgniter is fairly straightforward. Obviously, using Sentry in CodeIgniter brings the minimum PHP version to 5.3.0. To install, add the following to your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
	"require": {
		"cartalyst/sentry": "2.0.*",
		"illuminate/database": "4.0.*",
		"ircmaxell/password-compat": "1.0.*"
	},
	"minimum-stability": "dev"
}
```

> **Note**: You may need to merge the `require` attribute with that you already have in `composer.json`

Now, simply run `composer update`. Then, visit `application/config/config.php` and right down the bottom, add the following:

```php
class_alias('Cartalyst\Sentry\Facades\CI\Sentry', 'Sentry');
```

This will allow you to use Sentry as normal in CodeIgniter and sets up dependencies required for Sentry to run smoothly within the CI environment.

##### A small note

You must be running your database using the `PDO` driver (though this would be recommended anyway). Configuration for a MySQL database running PDO could be as follows (in `application/config/database.php`):

```php

// Ensure the active group is the default config.
// Sentry always runs off your application's default
// database connection.
$active_group = 'default';

// Setup the default config
$db['default'] = array(

	// PDO requires the host, dbname and charset are all specified in the "dsn",
	// so we'll go ahead and do these now.
	'dsn'	=> 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=cartalyst_sentry;charset=utf8;',
	'hostname' => 'localhost',
	'username' => 'root',
	'password' => 'root',
	'database' => '',
	'dbdriver' => 'pdo',
	'dbprefix' => '',
	'pconnect' => TRUE,
	'db_debug' => TRUE,
	'cache_on' => FALSE,
	'cachedir' => '',
	'char_set' => 'utf8',
	'dbcollat' => 'utf8_general_ci',
	'swap_pre' => '',
	'autoinit' => TRUE,
	'encrypt' => FALSE,
	'compress' => FALSE,
	'stricton' => FALSE,
	'failover' => array()
);
```


#### Installing Using Composer

Ensure you have the following in your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
	"require": {
		"cartalyst/sentry": "2.0.*",
		"illuminate/database": "1.2.*",
		"ircmaxell/password-compat": "1.0.*"
	}
}
```

```php

// Create an alias for our Facade
class_alias('Cartalyst\Sentry\Facades\Native\Sentry', 'Sentry');

// Setup our database
$dsn      = 'mysql:dbname=my_database;host=localhost';
$user     = 'root';
$password = 'password';
Sentry::setupDatabaseResolver(new PDO($dsn, $user, $password));

// Done!

// Create our first user!
$user = Sentry::getUserProvider()->create(array(
	'email'    => 'testing@test.com',
	'password' => 'test',
	'permissions' => array(
		'test'  => 1,
		'other' => -1,
		'admin' => 1
	)
));

var_dump($user);
```


#### Installing Using Composer (Customization example)

```json
{
	"require": {
		"cartalyst/sentry": "2.0.*"
	}
}
```

You heard us say how Sentry is completely interface driven? We have a number of implementations already built in for using Sentry which require the following `composer.json` file:

```json
{
	"require": {
		"cartalyst/sentry": "2.0.*",
		"illuminate/database": "1.2.*",
		"ircmaxell/password-compat": "1.0.*"
	}
}
```

Now run `php composer.phar update` from the command line.

Initializing Sentry requires you pass a number of dependencies to it. These dependencies are the following:

1. A hasher (must implement `Cartalyst\Sentry\Hashing\HasherInterface`).
2. A session manager (must implement `Cartalyst\Sentry\Sessions\SessionInterface`).
3. A cookie manager (must implement `Cartalyst\Sentry\Cookies\CookieInterface`).
4. A group provider (must implement `Cartalyst\Sentry\Groups\ProviderInterface`).
5. A user provider (must implement `Cartalyst\Sentry\Users\ProviderInterface`).
6. A throtte provider (must implement `Cartalyst\Sentry\Throttling\ProviderInterface`).

Of course, we provide default implementations of all these for you. To setup our default implementations, the following should suffice:

```php
<?php

$hasher = new Cartalyst\Sentry\Hashing\NativeHasher; // There are other hashers available, take your pick

$session = new Cartalyst\Sentry\Sessions\NativeSession;

// Note, all of the options below are, optional!
$options = array(
	'name'     => null, // Default "cartalyst_sentry"
	'time'     => null, // Default 300 seconds from now
	'domain'   => null, // Default ""
	'path'     => null, // Default "/"
	'secure'   => null, // Default "false"
	'httpOnly' => null, // Default "false"
);
$cookie = new Cartalyst\Sentry\Cookies\NativeCookie($options);

$groupProvider = new Cartalyst\Sentry\Groups\Eloquent\Provider;

$userProvider = new Cartalyst\Sentry\Users\Eloquent\Provider($hasher);

$throttleProvider = new Cartalyst\Sentry\Throttling\Eloquent\Provider($userProvider);

$sentry = new Sentry(
	$hasher,
	$session,
	$cookie,
	$groupProvider,
	$userProvider,
	$throttleProvider
);
```
